## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I... actually didn't do all that much, though I do actually plan on working on this project during the next few hours, and over break. I'll have to save those updates for next week's update.

I discussed the use of Carthage with Nick after saying that I didn't really like how it worked, having used CocoaPods for a while already... so he said that he'd be okay with my using CocoaPods.
That's what I'm doing now. I'll have to tell him that the .xcworkspace is going to be the file to work with from now on, not the .xcproject, but that's about all that will really change for him on his end, I think. CocoaPods is not exactly new (it predates Swift), but I have actual experience with it, while I have none for Carthage... which, upon inspection, seemed a little less "automated" than I wanted it to be, so to speak.

And I spent so much time talking about Carthage in previous entries. Whoops.

I'll spend some time getting used to the Charts pod we're going to use to display the data we're fetching from Core Data; luckily, it's all open-source (via the Apache 2.0 License), so I it should work out for our project.

So, to be fair to me, while I didn't do much coding, decisions were made: which package manager to use (CocoaPods), and which graphing library to use (Charts: https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts).

## This Week's Plan

Now that we've installed the requisite stuff, it's time to use it. I'd like to get some sort of charts charted by the weekend's end; given that I've gotten that Core Data practice in already, I don't think retrieving data is going to be the tough part.

The talk of dynamically resizing/modifying UI elements for a specific device from my previous update still stands as a future goal.

## Anything Blocking?

There are still no notable challenges I've run into yet.

## Notes

It was mentioned during one of the meetings (if memory serves) that a link to our commits might be appreciated. Here you go: https://github.com/nicklczk/HowAreYou/commits/master
