## Last Week's Accomplishments

MarkerViews finally adjust their position smoothly rather than jerking away from the edge of the screen. It's actually pretty nice.

I've also begun to implement a settings page, where a user will be able to delete all their data and customize the color of their graph's line. More stuff will go there in the future, I'm sure, as more features are added; I'm leaving in a "delete current graph's data" hidden in the storyboard for if we eventually move on to implementing multiple surveys.

## This Week's Plan

I still haven't quite figured out how to color-code the data based on its value, but I'm leaving it here as a potential desire anyway, since I think it might be nice, at least as an option.

The SettingsViewController is just a bunch of dumb UI elements right now; getting them to actually do something will be the next step in getting that up and running, and since I only have two (active) controls, it's not going to be a huge effort getting them to work.

## Anything Blocking?

Not yet, but I should probably check in with Nick to see how his work on the More Resources page is coming along, and what that UI consultation team thinks of what we've got so far.

## Notes

Whoops, another Sunday update.

Am I the only person that thinks RCOS is the most fun I'm having at RPI right now? Surely, I can't be...
