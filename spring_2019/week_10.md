## Last Week's Accomplishments

Since my last status update, I've added a icons for the tab bar (and an accompanying about box, because the licensing terms of the icons I used require it, but nothing else), I've fixed up Nick's more resources page so that it now scrolls as it should, and I made the disclaimer resize automatically to fit the size of the screen a lot better than it did before, when using the app on a large device would result in a ton of white space on the screen while the static text was tiny.

## This Week's Plan

Present! And perhaps add the App icon in after that.

This week I've got two tests I should be studying for, so I'm not planning on doing all that much for RCOS (besides the presentation) until the weekend at the soonest.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing is blocking at this time.

## Notes

I've been spending more time being anxious than actually studying, but hopefully I'll be able to get some actual studying in before my upcoming test... 

...and while this update is late, I again think they're better late than never... this week is probably going to be the toughest this entire semester.
