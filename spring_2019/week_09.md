## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've further refined the behavior of MakerViews, so it should be a little bit harder to break them or to get them to draw at ridiculous sizes. 

I've also fully implemented the settings screen. You can now delete all your data and set a color for your chart line there, and it all works as you'd expect. The line color itself uses UserDefaults, so it's not quite stored in the same way as the chart data, but it should be fine because the color is really just a number (a floating-point value for hue).

## This Week's Plan

I think we're just going to work on the presentation this upcoming week, since our presentation will be pretty soon. We have enough of a working app, and I'm told that Nick is almost done with the More Resources page, so we should be able to get it done to a decently-working version by the time demos start.

I think the one thing I might want to do before then is actually put icons in the tabs for the tab bar, because somehow, I haven't yet.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing is blocking at this time.

## Notes

I'm nervous for presentations, but I'm not too nervous... 

I wonder what it's going to be like, and how difficult getting a good presentation grade will be. Nick has started it and I'll help him out; from what I've seen of it so far, it looks decent.
